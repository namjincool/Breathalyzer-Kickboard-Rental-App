## Appendix

This project is an application made with only 3 kickboards. Afterwards, additional kickboards have the hassle of having to be re-implement. For additional modifications, it is recommended to save and use the kickboard information with JSON.


## Deployment

This Android app has only saved front-end and back-end implementations, so you need to receive both xml and java separately when building separately
